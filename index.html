          <strong>FOXSTRAT</strong> was founded by two driven developers,
          <strong>Vaughn</strong> and <strong>Johnlloyd</strong>, who saw the
          need for a smarter, faster, and more adaptable security solution. What
          started as a passion project aimed at building a lightweight malware
          scanner quickly turned into something bigger. With growing concerns
          around online threats and privacy, they set out to develop an
          antivirus that not only detects but anticipates threats using AI and
          real-time data.
          <br>
          <br>
          Drawing from their backgrounds in cybersecurity and
          software development, Vaughn and Johnlloyd worked tirelessly to build
          a product that was powerful, user-friendly, and platform-agnostic.
          Over time, their software evolved into a full-featured, cross-platform
          antivirus solution trusted by users worldwide. Today, their vision
          continues to drive innovation - making digital safety simpler and more
          reliable for everyone.
